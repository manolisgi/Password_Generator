# Password_Generator

## Description 

In this repo I used my JavaScript skills in order to create an app that will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

This Password Generator can use :

      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters

## Usage 

The app is randomly generating passwords from 10 to 64 characters.
